                    Crowdfunding</funder>
                <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a lead gift from Dr Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for this additional support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early modern drama, theatre and book history.</funder>

                            <decoNote>With an engraved title-page portrait of the author signed: "Martin-
                                Droeshout: sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2 states: 1. The earlier
                                state has lighter shading generall ; 2. Later state has heavier shading,
                                especially around the collar, and minor differences particularly with the
                                jawline and moustache. The vast majority of surviving copies have the plate
                                in the second state which has led some scholars to conclude that the earlier
                                state was a proof. The portrait in this copy is the second state.

                                <lb/>there begins my sadnesse: My brother <hi rend="italic">Iaques</hi> he keepes

                                <l>His Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant,</l>
                                <l>Mewling, and puking in the Nurses armes:</l>
                                <l>Then, the whining Schoole&#x2011;boy with his Satchell</l>
                                <l>And shining morning face, creeping like snaile</l>
                                <l>Vnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer,</l>
                                <l>Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad</l>
                                <l>Made to his Mistresse eye&#x2011;brow. Then, a Soldier,</l>
                                <l>Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard,</l>
                                <l>Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell,</l>
                                <l>Seeking the bubble Reputation</l>
                                <l>Euen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice</l>
                                <l>In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd,</l>
                                <l>With eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut,</l>
                                <l>Full of wise sawes, and moderne instances,</l>
                                <l>And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts</l>
                                <l>Into the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone,</l>
                                <l>With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,</l>
                                <l>His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide,</l>
                                <l>For his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice,</l>
                                <l>Turning againe toward childish trebble pipes,</l>
                                <l>And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all,</l>
                                <l>That ends this strange euentfull historie,</l>
                                <l>Is second childishnesse, and meere obliuion,</l>
                                <l>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.</l>

                                    <lb/>no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue. 
                                    <lb/>Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good

                                    <lb/>of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men) 
                                    <lb/>for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your

                                    <lb/>and the women, the play may please. If I were a Wo&#x00AD;
                                    <lb/>man, I would kisse as many of you as had beards that

                                    <lb/>I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good
                                    <lb/>beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind
