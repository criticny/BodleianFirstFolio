          Crowdfunding</funder>
            <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a lead gift from Dr Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for this additional support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early modern drama, theatre and book history.</funder>

                Droeshout: sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2 states: 1. The earlier
                state has lighter shading generall ; 2. Later state has heavier shading,
                especially around the collar, and minor differences particularly with the
                jawline and moustache. The vast majority of surviving copies have the plate
                in the second state which has led some scholars to conclude that the earlier
                state was a proof. The portrait in this copy is the second state.

                to the disposal of this copy, but there is a record of a sale of

                bookseller in Oxford, in <date when="1664">1664</date> for the sum of <num value="24">¬£24</num>.</p>

                the collection of <persName>Richard Turbutt</persName> of Ogston Hall,
                Derbyshire at some point in the early 18th century. It stayed in the
                family‚Äôs possession until <date when="1906">1906</date>, when it was
                reacquired by the Bodleian for the sum of <num value="3000">¬£3000</num>,
                raised by public subscription. For a full discussion of the rediscovery and
